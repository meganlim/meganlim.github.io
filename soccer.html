       Soccer has been the most long-lasting, consistent activity in my life. I originally started playing when I was 7, not because I was attracted to the sport itself, but because whenever I went to my brother’s games I would jokingly tell myself, ”I can do better than that”. But soon I realized that Tuesday’s practice was the number one event I could not wait for every week. At 11, I joined the highest level of club soccer, Premier, and continued playing in addition to the high school league all the way up until college. At UC Berkeley, soccer has remained a strong presence in my life through IM or spontaneous indoor pickup games. <br><br>
