  For Diagnostics, I first worked on the Diagnostic Reasoner (DR) manual that served to teach software users
  how to implement the DR algorithm.  DR is a software created by NASA to detect and identify the failure
  or failures that have occurred within a system.  The D-matrix, a part of DR, is utilized to store the relationships between
  tests and failures modes in a compact way.  The algorithm then steps through the matrix table and assigns
  descriptive values to the failure modes. It's applicability to many systems allows it diagnose varied
  technologies depending on interest.<br><br>

  After Diagnostics determines the failures associated with a particular system of interest, Prognostics then evaluates
  the evolution of these failures and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the system.<br><br>
