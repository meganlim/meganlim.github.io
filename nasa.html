       My NASA internship was out of this world! I worked with the algorithms implemented in the Diagnostics and Prognostics Research Group at NASA.
       The software user manual that I wrote for one of the Diagnostic algorithms, Diagnostic Reasoner,
       was released in the US along with the open source software. I also wrote the 19 page Github wiki for GSAP, a major Prognostics
       architecture, and Metrics library wiki. Later, I was one out of 5 interns selected to present my project at the
       Intelligent Systems Division Showcase where I was interviewed for Kiwoba Allaire's video to give advice to
       young girls on how to pursue STEM.<br><br>
