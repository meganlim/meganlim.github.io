     <h3>Supporting NASA'S Open Source Diagnostic and Prognostics Software</h3><br>
     <div>As a Tech Intern at NASA, I worked under the
       <a href = "https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/diagnostics-and-prognostics/">
       Diagnostics and Prognostics Research group.
      </a>
      If you click the hyperlink to the left, you will be redirected to the NASA Diagnostics and Prognostics Research group home page.
      It will attempt to explain what each of its divisions' purposes are, but it likely won't make any sense.  It took myself a
      few weeks into my internship to understand what the group actually does and fully comprehend the description on the website.<br><br>

      Essentially, Diagnostics serves to discover and identify the faults of a system while Prognostic's main function is to
      determine the evolution of these faults.  Algorithms have been and are currently being developed in each
      of these divisions. Metrics are then utilized to evaluate the performance and accuracy of these algorithms.<br><br>

      Throughout my internship, I worked with the algorithms implemented in these groups.<br><br>
