       I independently published math and physics books that are for sale on Amazon US/Europe. Striving to give the learner a geometric, as well as conceptual, understanding of Linear Algebra, I supplemented each concept with visuals such as color coordinated flowcharts and vector diagrams. In order to elucidate the bigger picture, I introduced on the first page and revisited on the last, that the bridge between Linear Algebra & Differential Equations, is the subtle concept: linear combinations. In the physics book, I dissected every pulley or banked turn problem to bring the reader back to the fundamentals and highlight major concepts they may have missed. Ultimately, finding creative ways to simplify complex, technical topics was a challenging but deeply rewarding process.  <span class="purpleText">Click on the books to turn the page!</span><br><br>
