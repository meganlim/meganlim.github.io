       <p class = "title"> Religion </p>

       <p>
         In Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment Raskolnikov defies one of the most fundamental commandments in religion: murder.  The splitting of the novel into two parts, the act of killing and the continual torment that ensues, is demonstrative of the abstraction in crime.   Raskolnikov serves as an experimentation in which Dostoevsky studies the capability of religion to relieve a man in the greatest of suffering.  Religion and the devotion to a set of beliefs, are underlying concepts that not only play significant roles in Raskolnikov’s development but also set the stages for major scenes.  The utilization of religion as a foundation in factors external to Raskolnikov enables the study of the process in which they influence and shape Raskolnikov.  The intentional ambiguity in the definition of religion throughout the novel is illustrative of its relativity and malleability to differing psychology.  Subjectivity of religious definition allows both personal belief and conventional principles already accepted by society to contribute to the development of character.  Raskolnikov and the climactic struggle towards his fate questions whether religion serves as merely an escape for wronged actions or rather a justified and meritable doctrine.  The novel, composed of major scenes fundamentally rooted in theology and scattered with religious references, is a microcosm for the universal truth that which Dostoevsky studies of whether faith is the backbone of both passion and rationality.
       </p>

       <p>
         Following the explanation of his article in the Periodical Discourse to Razumikhin and Porfiry, Raskolnikov confirms his faith in God, the New Jerusalem, and the raising of the Lazarus with resolution and then gradual hesitation.  This scene is significant in that it demonstrates Raskolnikov’s ambiguous relationship with religion.  The placement of Raskolnikov’s brief and terse response to Porfiry’s interrogation of his faith immediately after his lengthy tirade on his article creates a disruption and pace of rhythm in the text.  This quick break in Raskolnikov’s momentum of thought questions whether his affirmation of conventional religious principles is rooted in truth or rather in the heated desire to prove a point.  His audience, being both Razumikhin and Porfiry, is composed of both friend and foe.  Razumikhin, although a proven loyal and devoted friend, is a character that which Raskolnikov considers an understanding man but incapable of comprehending his theory of the divide between extraordinary and ordinary.  In fact, it is Raskolnikov’s annoyance of Razumikhin’s  misunderstanding of his article that initially drives him into deep explanation and “acceptance of the challenge”.  Porfiry, seen as a man dangerous to Raskolnikov’s implementation of his philosophy, is an even greater incentive for Raskolnikov to rashly declare faith in all of the three distinct principles brought up.  The composition of his audience, consisting of the ignorant and untrustworthy, indicates that Raskolnikov’s confirmation of religious faith in this scene serves to convince others rather than himself.
       </p>

       <p>
         At the conclusion of his lecture, Raskolnikov interestingly utilizes the New Jerusalem, an example of conventional doctrine, as justification for the personal principles displayed in his article.  The justification is founded in Raskolnikov’s belief in his abilities to self construct his own utopian regime here on earth.  This “New Jerusalem” that which he attempts to build is manufactured on the basis of his crime and the assumed responsibility to commit this crime.  When Porfiry pounces on this opportunity, with each question there is notable hesitation in Raskolnikov’s conviction that had previously dominated his passionate tirade.  This equivocation, illustrated by his observation of the ground and stuttering of “I be-believe”, is demonstrative of Raskolnikov’s insecurity when his self constructed principles are placed in comparison with those of Christianity.  Porfiry’s inquiry of whether Raskolnikov’s faith is “literal” reveals that Raskolnikov may be attracted to the idea of strict adherence to a set of principles rather than the actual essence of the principles themselves.  Because Raskolnikov has conviction only in his man-made principles and not the words of the Gospel, his faith does not depend on the “literal”. The style to position this interrogation succeeding Raskolnikov’s rant serves to draw parallels between his manufactured theories and religious fundamentals.  Passion, being the foundation of his personal principles, is the obstruction in Raskolnikov’s sight of what is rational and is the motivating factor that drives him to commit his crime.  His belief in the dichotomy of mankind between the extraordinary and ordinary implies the haughty consideration of himself to be almost god-like.  At this elevated state of untouchability he reserves the right and responsibility to commit actions for the betterment of society even if it required compromising his humanity.  In this scene Raskolnikov implicitly justifies his murder of the pawnbroker as a duty specifically designated for only him to commit and a necessity to following the guidelines of his own fabricated “religion”.  The painter’s unsuccessful false confession at the beginning of the novel is further evidence that only Raskolnikov is capable of owning his crime.
       </p>

       <p>
          Sonya’s forced reading of the Lazarus section in the New Testament is representative of Raskolnikov’s apprehension in the legitimacy of religion.  This scene is powerful in that Sonya, a symbol of sacrifice and suffering, is contrived to read a passage of words by a man who could not voice them himself.  Two characters of great misery are confronted by strict divinity in this scene but one finds strength while the other finds distress.  Although trembling and voice shaking at the introduction of her reading, as the passage of Lazarus progresses she begins to enunciate her words with greater conviction and becomes master of the faith that which she possesses.  In this scene, as Sonya’s voice stabilizes, the adjustment of balance between passion and rationality is evident.  In the face of greatest adversity Sonya instinctively finds strength in moral law and is an example of successful implementation of religion.  However, Raskolnikov’s anxiety is founded in his inability to understand why his spiritual journey towards salvation is unsuccessful and comprised of endless torment.  This cycle of reclusion and despair that which Raskolnikov perpetuates for himself is broken when Raskolnikov allows himself to emerge from a position of isolation and gradually accept external factors to act on him.  Sonya, exemplification of a “literal” follower in religion, is a monumental external factor in the establishment of Raskolnikov’s identity basis with religion.  Raskolnikov’s choice of Sonya to read aloud the words of the Gospel is in an indication of his trust in her moral judgement and the turning point in which he realizes religion may be the solution to his suffering.
       </p>

       <p>
         Sonya’s forced reading could be linked back to Raskolnikov’s prior confirmation of the raising of Lazarus in the scene of Porfiry’s interrogation.  Raskolnikov’s attraction to the rising of Lazarus, a concept reinforced twice, serves to emphasize the struggle that which Raskolnikov undergoes throughout the course of the novel to achieve salvation.  Raskolnikov’s annoyance arises from his inability to symbolically emerge from his position of suffering like Lazarus, although not of his own accord, had so successfully done.  The punishment that he undergoes after the crime he commits serves as stark realization that Raskolnikov may not fulfill the role of extraordinary that he believes he possesses.  The merit of his self-made doctrine crumbles under the unforeseen need for forgiveness and unexpected pain of isolation.  As the anguish of sin begins to dominate his life, Raskolnikov attempts to turn to a possible solution or alleviation of his suffering and thus experiments with religion.  The progression of the novel consists of half hearted attempts to ask for forgiveness but because he cannot achieve resurrection, Raskolnikov begins to consider religion as a faulty concept or empty promise.  At the conclusion of the novel, Sonya will serve as the ultimate motivating factor that converts these half hearted attempts into Raskolnikov’s total embracement of religion.
       </p>

       <p>
         Raskolnikov’s ultimate acceptance of religion as a mechanism to achieve salvation culminates at the end of the novel when he follows Sonya’s advice and confesses at the crossroads.  Along the way to his confession at the police station, Raskolnikov remembers Sonya’s words and is overcome by sudden passionate understanding and “caught fire in his soul”.  This monumental scene of Raskolnikov throwing himself to the ground and kissing the earth is symbolic for his ultimate surrender.  The meeting of his lips with the earth is emblematic of rebirth and the return to what had created him.  It is the act of final enlightenment that surrender is the only means to escape the perpetuating cycle of torment he had created for himself.  Relinquishing himself at a location for all to see is demonstrative of the purity in his confession and acknowledgement that no person can take ownership of his sin.  This claim over his crime is based no longer on pride and haughtiness but rather on shame.  This scene completes Raskolnikov’s understanding that religious principle should not be an excuse for his actions but rather a proven concept to seek forgiveness of those actions.  By taking the “fire in his soul” and converting it into an act of exhibition, Raskolnikov conquers what it means to have control of both passion and rationality.  He finds resolution within his interpretation of religion and utilizes this understanding to set the stage for his emergence from darkness much like Lazarus.
       </p>

       <p>
         This scene is linked back to Porfiry’s investigation when an observant tradesman remarks that Raskolnikov is headed towards Jerusalem.  The repetitive referencing of the New Jerusalem questions the legitimacy of this “heaven on earth” and whether its existence is fantasized or actually an attainable goal.  This novel serves as an investigation into whether Raskolnikov is capable of discovering this New Jerusalem even after committing so atrocious a crime.  It places a character within a test case scenario and follows the psychological and spiritual implications that arise from his attempt to reach this New Jerusalem.  Ultimate repentance at the crossroads is representative of Raskolnikov’s final break from religious hesitation and finally places him on path towards New Jerusalem.  Sonya’s accompaniment with Raskolnikov to the crossroads, while not directly acknowledged by Raskolnikov, represents the necessity of Sonya’s character in his ultimate religious enlightenment and break from isolation.  It is her words, both her advice and her gospel reading of Lazarus, that finally propel Raskolnikov towards faith in a doctrine not written by himself.  The overcoming of security and comfort when he sees Sonya hiding empowers one of the strongest connection between characters in the novel.  This mutual understanding between two characters of great suffering serves as evidence that religion is a proven concept validated by self-sacrifice.
       </p>

       <p>
         Ultimately, Raskolnikov is the strain on a system in which Dostoevsky studies the balance between passion and rationality.  At the beginning of the novel, Raskolnikov is the complete embodiment of passionate and irrational thinking and this drives him to commit one of the greatest religious sins: murder.  However, his progression throughout the novel, encouraged by Sonya’s motivation and encouragement, allows rationality to become an increasingly dominant factor in his identity.  As Raskolnikov ends the novel with ultimate enlightenment and successful repentance of his sins, Dostoevsky concludes that religion is the harmonious interplay between passion and rationality.  Religion is the controlled devotion in an orderly set of principles proven by Raskolnikov’s arduous battle towards his eventual liberation from sin.

class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Fyodor Dostoevsky&rsquo;s </span><span class="c5 c6">Crime and Punishment</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Raskolnikov defies one of the most fundamental commandments in religion: murder. &nbsp;The splitting of the novel into two parts, the act of killing and the continual torment that ensues, is demonstrative of the abstraction in crime. &nbsp; Raskolnikov serves as an experimentation in which Dostoevsky studies the capability of religion to relieve a man in the greatest of suffering. &nbsp;Religion and the devotion to a set of beliefs, are underlying concepts that not only play significant roles in Raskolnikov&rsquo;s development but also set the stages for major scenes. &nbsp;The utilization of religion as a foundation in factors external to Raskolnikov enables the study of the process in which they influence and shape Raskolnikov. &nbsp;The intentional ambiguity in the definition of religion throughout the novel is illustrative of its relativity and malleability to differing psychology. &nbsp;Subjectivity of religious definition allows both personal belief and conventional principles already accepted by society to contribute to the development of character. &nbsp;Raskolnikov and the climactic struggle towards his fate questions whether religion serves as merely an escape for wronged actions or rather a justified and meritable doctrine. &nbsp;The novel, composed of major scenes fundamentally rooted in theology and scattered with religious references, is a microcosm for the universal truth that which Dostoevsky studies of whether faith is the backbone of both passion and rationality.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the explanation of his article in the </span><span class="c5 c6">Periodical Discourse</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to Razumikhin and Porfiry, Raskolnikov confirms his faith in God, the New Jerusalem, and the raising of the Lazarus with resolution and then gradual hesitation. &nbsp;This scene is significant in that it demonstrates Raskolnikov&rsquo;s ambiguous relationship with religion. &nbsp;The placement of Raskolnikov&rsquo;s brief and terse response to Porfiry&rsquo;s interrogation of his faith immediately after his lengthy tirade on his article creates a disruption and pace of rhythm in the text. &nbsp;This quick break in Raskolnikov&rsquo;s momentum of thought questions whether his affirmation of conventional religious principles is rooted in truth or rather in the heated desire to prove a point. &nbsp;His audience, being both Razumikhin and Porfiry, is composed of both friend and foe. &nbsp;Razumikhin, although a proven loyal and devoted friend, is a character that which Raskolnikov considers an understanding man but incapable of comprehending his theory of the divide between extraordinary and ordinary. &nbsp;In fact, it is Raskolnikov&rsquo;s annoyance of Razumikhin&rsquo;s &nbsp;misunderstanding of his article that initially drives him into deep explanation and &ldquo;acceptance of the challenge&rdquo;. &nbsp;Porfiry, seen as a man dangerous to Raskolnikov&rsquo;s implementation of his philosophy, is an even greater incentive for Raskolnikov to rashly declare faith in all of the three distinct principles brought up. &nbsp;The composition of his audience, consisting of the ignorant and untrustworthy, indicates that Raskolnikov&rsquo;s confirmation of religious faith in this scene serves to convince others rather than himself.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">At the conclusion of his lecture, Raskolnikov interestingly utilizes the New Jerusalem, an example of conventional doctrine, as justification for the personal principles displayed in his article. &nbsp;The justification is founded in Raskolnikov&rsquo;s belief in his abilities to self construct his own utopian regime here on earth. &nbsp;This &ldquo;New Jerusalem&rdquo; that which he attempts to build is manufactured on the basis of his crime and the assumed responsibility to commit this crime. &nbsp;When Porfiry pounces on this opportunity, with each question there is notable hesitation in Raskolnikov&rsquo;s conviction that had previously dominated his passionate tirade. &nbsp;This equivocation, illustrated by his observation of the ground and stuttering of &ldquo;I be-believe&rdquo;, is demonstrative of Raskolnikov&rsquo;s insecurity when his self constructed principles are placed in comparison with those of Christianity. &nbsp;Porfiry&rsquo;s inquiry of whether Raskolnikov&rsquo;s faith is &ldquo;literal&rdquo; reveals that Raskolnikov may be attracted to the idea of strict adherence to a set of principles rather than the actual essence of the principles themselves. &nbsp;Because Raskolnikov has conviction only in his man-made principles and not the words of the Gospel, his faith does not depend on the &ldquo;literal&rdquo;. The style to position this interrogation succeeding Raskolnikov&rsquo;s rant serves to draw parallels between his manufactured theories and religious fundamentals. &nbsp;Passion, being the foundation of his personal principles, is the obstruction in Raskolnikov&rsquo;s sight of what is rational and is the motivating factor that drives him to commit his crime. &nbsp;His belief in the dichotomy of mankind between the extraordinary and ordinary implies the haughty consideration of himself to be almost god-like. &nbsp;At this elevated state of untouchability he reserves the right and responsibility to commit actions for the betterment of society even if it required compromising his humanity. &nbsp;In this scene Raskolnikov implicitly justifies his murder of the pawnbroker as a duty specifically designated for only him to commit and a necessity to following the guidelines of his own fabricated &ldquo;religion&rdquo;. &nbsp;The painter&rsquo;s unsuccessful false confession at the beginning of the novel is further evidence that only Raskolnikov is capable of owning his crime.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Sonya&rsquo;s forced reading of the Lazarus section in the New Testament is representative of Raskolnikov&rsquo;s apprehension in the legitimacy of religion. &nbsp;This scene is powerful in that Sonya, a symbol of sacrifice and suffering, is contrived to read a passage of words by a man who could not voice them himself. &nbsp;Two characters of great misery are confronted by strict divinity in this scene but one finds strength while the other finds distress. &nbsp;Although trembling and voice shaking at the introduction of her reading, as the passage of Lazarus progresses she begins to enunciate her words with greater conviction and becomes master of the faith that which she possesses. &nbsp;In this scene, as Sonya&rsquo;s voice stabilizes, the adjustment of balance between passion and rationality is evident. &nbsp;In the face of greatest adversity Sonya instinctively finds strength in moral law and is an example of successful implementation of religion. &nbsp;However, Raskolnikov&rsquo;s anxiety is founded in his inability to understand why his spiritual journey towards salvation is unsuccessful and comprised of endless torment. &nbsp;This cycle of reclusion and despair that which Raskolnikov perpetuates for himself is broken when Raskolnikov allows himself to emerge from a position of isolation and gradually accept external factors to act on him. &nbsp;Sonya, exemplification of a &ldquo;literal&rdquo; follower in religion, is a monumental external factor in the establishment of Raskolnikov&rsquo;s identity basis with religion. &nbsp;Raskolnikov&rsquo;s choice of Sonya to read aloud the words of the Gospel is in an indication of his trust in her moral judgement and the turning point in which he realizes religion may be the solution to his suffering.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Sonya&rsquo;s forced reading could be linked back to Raskolnikov&rsquo;s prior confirmation of the raising of Lazarus in the scene of Porfiry&rsquo;s interrogation. &nbsp;Raskolnikov&rsquo;s attraction to the rising of Lazarus, a concept reinforced twice, serves to emphasize the struggle that which Raskolnikov undergoes throughout the course of the novel to achieve salvation. &nbsp;Raskolnikov&rsquo;s annoyance arises from his inability to symbolically emerge from his position of suffering like Lazarus, although not of his own accord, had so successfully done. &nbsp;The punishment that he undergoes after the crime he commits serves as stark realization that Raskolnikov may not fulfill the role of extraordinary that he believes he possesses. &nbsp;The merit of his self-made doctrine crumbles under the unforeseen need for forgiveness and unexpected pain of isolation. &nbsp;As the anguish of sin begins to dominate his life, Raskolnikov attempts to turn to a possible solution or alleviation of his suffering and thus experiments with religion. &nbsp;The progression of the novel consists of half hearted attempts to ask for forgiveness but because he cannot achieve resurrection, Raskolnikov begins to consider religion as a faulty concept or empty promise. &nbsp;At the conclusion of the novel, Sonya will serve as the ultimate motivating factor that converts these half hearted attempts into Raskolnikov&rsquo;s total embracement of religion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raskolnikov&rsquo;s ultimate acceptance of religion as a mechanism to achieve salvation culminates at the end of the novel when he follows Sonya&rsquo;s advice and confesses at the crossroads. &nbsp;Along the way to his confession at the police station, Raskolnikov remembers Sonya&rsquo;s words and is overcome by sudden passionate understanding and &ldquo;caught fire in his soul&rdquo;. &nbsp;This monumental scene of Raskolnikov throwing himself to the ground and kissing the earth is symbolic for his ultimate surrender. &nbsp;The meeting of his lips with the earth is emblematic of rebirth and the return to what had created him. &nbsp;It is the act of final enlightenment that surrender is the only means to escape the perpetuating cycle of torment he had created for himself. &nbsp;Relinquishing himself at a location for all to see is demonstrative of the purity in his confession and acknowledgement that no person can take ownership of his sin. &nbsp;This claim over his crime is based no longer on pride and haughtiness but rather on shame. &nbsp;This scene completes Raskolnikov&rsquo;s understanding that religious principle should not be an excuse for his actions but rather a proven concept to seek forgiveness of those actions. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">By taking the &ldquo;fire in his soul&rdquo; and converting it into an act of exhibition, Raskolnikov conquers what it means to have control of both passion and rationality. </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;He finds resolution within his interpretation of religion and utilizes this understanding to set the stage for his emergence from darkness much like Lazarus.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">This scene is linked back to Porfiry&rsquo;s investigation when an observant tradesman remarks that Raskolnikov is headed towards Jerusalem. &nbsp;The repetitive referencing of the New Jerusalem questions the legitimacy of this &ldquo;heaven on earth&rdquo; and whether its existence is fantasized or actually an attainable goal. &nbsp;This novel serves as an investigation into whether Raskolnikov is capable of discovering this New Jerusalem even after committing so atrocious a crime. &nbsp;It places a character within a test case scenario and follows the psychological and spiritual implications that arise from his attempt to reach this New Jerusalem. &nbsp;Ultimate repentance at the crossroads is representative of Raskolnikov&rsquo;s final break from religious hesitation and finally places him on path towards New Jerusalem. &nbsp;Sonya&rsquo;s accompaniment with Raskolnikov to the crossroads, while not directly acknowledged by Raskolnikov, represents the necessity of Sonya&rsquo;s character in his ultimate religious enlightenment and break from isolation. &nbsp;It is her words, both her advice and her gospel reading of Lazarus, that finally propel Raskolnikov towards faith in a doctrine not written by himself. &nbsp;The overcoming of security and comfort when he sees Sonya hiding empowers one of the strongest connection between characters in the novel. &nbsp;This mutual understanding between two characters of great suffering serves as evidence that religion is a proven concept validated by self-sacrifice.</span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Ultimately, Raskolnikov is the strain on a system in which Dostoevsky studies the balance between passion and rationality. &nbsp;At the beginning of the novel, Raskolnikov is the complete embodiment of passionate and irrational thinking and this drives him to commit one of the greatest religious sins: murder. &nbsp;However, his progression throughout the novel, encouraged by Sonya&rsquo;s motivation and encouragement, allows rationality to become an increasingly dominant factor in his identity. &nbsp;As Raskolnikov ends the novel with ultimate enlightenment and successful repentance of his sins, Dostoevsky concludes that religion is the harmonious interplay between passion and rationality. &nbsp;Religion is the controlled devotion in an orderly set of principles proven by Raskolnikov&rsquo;s arduous battle towards his eventual liberation from sin.</span></p><p class="c2 c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html> -->
