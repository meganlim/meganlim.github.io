       I currently serve on the SWE Outreach Committee, dedicated to promoting STEM education among the younger generation.
       I am a SWE Science Saturday Instructor in which I lead sessions to teach science and engineering principles to middle schoolers.
       In SWENext Mentorship, I mentor a high school student to help navigate high school and learn about college.
       I will also be speaking at a panel for SWE's Mini University hosted at UC Berkeley on Nov 18, 2019.<br><br>
